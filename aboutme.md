### the full story

 starting my journey in **Information Science**, i initially aimed to become a bioinformatician but soon discovered my passion for data visualization, large datasets, and uncovering insights that drive real-world decisions. this pivot led me to explore how analytics and data-driven strategies can tackle critical challenges across various industries. i specialize in **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **machine learning**, with hands-on experience in **Python**, **R**, and **HPCC systems**.

my experiences range from healthcare informatics research, where i examined the intersection of mental health and telemedicine, to applying UX/UI principles for enhanced **user-centered designs**. i'm driven by the potential to make meaningful differences through **data-informed decision making**, whether that's improving patient outcomes in healthcare, optimizing business strategies, or enhancing user experiences through thoughtful design. my ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between complex datasets and practical solutions, using analytical techniques to solve multifaceted problems and foster innovation across any field i work in!
